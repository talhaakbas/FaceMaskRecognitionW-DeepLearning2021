# FaceMaskRecognitionW-DeepLearning2021
This project is a deep learning-based face mask detection system developed using PyTorch. The goal is to classify whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not, which can be helpful in enforcing safety protocols in public spaces or institutions during pandemics such as COVID-19.
